Stananought

of
Trident House, 105 Derby Road, Liverpool, L20 8LZ
was a Director of Swanky 
                                          Malone Limited, which traded as Swanky Malone, during the 12 months ending with the

29 February 
                                             2024
when it entered Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation.
I give notice that it is my intention to act in one or more of the ways specified
                                          in Section 216(3) of the Insolvency 
                                          Act 1986 in connection with, or for the purpose of, the carrying on of the whole or
                                          substantially the whole of 
                                          the business of the insolvent Company under the name Swanky Properties Limited trading

Swanky 
                                          Malone.
I would otherwise not be permitted to undertake those activities without leave of
                                          the Court or the application of 
                                          an exception created by Rules under the Insolvency Act 1986 and a breach of the prohibition
                                          created by 
                                          Section 216 is a criminal offence.
Please note that I am also a director of Swanky Malone Education Ltd which is a dormant
                                          company that no 
                                          longer trades and is in the process of being removed from the Register of Companies.
Section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 lists the activities that a director of
                                          a company that has gone into insolvent liquidation may not undertake unless the court
                                          gives permission or there is an exception in the Insolvency Rules made under the Insolvency
                                          Act 1986. (This includes the exceptions in Part 22 of the Insolvency (England and
                                          Wales) Rules 2016). These activities are-
(a)	acting as a director of another company that is known by a name which is either
                                          the same as a name used by the company in insolvent liquidation in the 12 months before
                                          it entered liquidation or is so similar as to suggest an association with that company;
(b)	directly or indirectly being concerned or taking part in the promotion, formation
                                          or management of any such company; or
(c)	directly or indirectly being concerned in the carrying on of a business otherwise
                                          than through a company under a name of the kind mentioned in (a) above.
This notice is given under rule 22.4 of the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016
                                          where the business of a company which is in, or may go into, insolvent liquidation
                                          is, or is to be, carried on otherwise than by the company in liquidation with the
                                          involvement of a director of that company and under the same or a similar name to
                                          that of that company.
The purpose of the giving of this notice is to permit the director to act in these
                                          circumstances where the company enters (or has entered) insolvent liquidation without
                                          the director committing a criminal offence and in the case of the carrying on of the
                                          business through another company, being personally liable for that company’s debts.
Notice may be given where the person giving the notice is already the director of
                                          a company which proposes to adopt a prohibited name.

, was a director of the above-named company during the 12 months ending with the day
                                          before it went into liquidation.
I give notice that it is my intention to act in all or any of the ways specified in
                                          section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 in connection with, or for the purposes
                                          of, the carrying on of the whole or substantially the whole of the business of the
                                          insolvent company under the following name:
Wah Bey.
Section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 lists the activities that a director of
                                          a company that has gone into insolvent liquidation may not undertake unless the court
                                          gives permission or there is an exception in the Insolvency Rules made under the Insolvency
                                          Act 1986. (This includes the exceptions in Part 22 of the Insolvency (England and
                                          Wales) Rules 2016). These activities are-
(a)	acting as a director of another company that is known by a name which is either
                                          the same as a name used by the company in insolvent liquidation in the 12 months before
                                          it entered liquidation or is so similar as to suggest an association with that company;
(b)	directly or indirectly being concerned or taking part in the promotion, formation
                                          or management of any such company; or
(c)	directly or indirectly being concerned in the carrying on of a business otherwise
                                          than through a company under a name of the kind mentioned in (a) above.
This notice is given under rule 22.4 of the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016
                                          where the business of a company which is in, or may go into, insolvent liquidation
                                          is, or is to be, carried on otherwise than by the company in liquidation with the
                                          involvement of a director of that company and under the same or a similar name to
                                          that of that company.
The purpose of the giving of this notice is to permit the director to act in these
                                          circumstances where the company enters (or has entered) insolvent liquidation without
                                          the director committing a criminal offence and in the case of the carrying on of the
                                          business through another company, being personally liable for that company’s debts.
Notice may be given where the person giving the notice is already the director of
                                          a company which proposes to adopt a prohibited name.

                                          I give notice that it is my intention to act in one or more of the ways specified
                                          in section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 in connection with, or for the purposes
                                          of, the carrying on of the whole or substantially the whole of the business of the
                                          insolvent company through West End Groove Ltd    t/a Coyote Ugly Saloon.
Section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 lists the activities that a director of
                                          a company that has gone into insolvent liquidation may not undertake unless the court
                                          gives permission or there is an exception in the Insolvency Rules made under the Insolvency
                                          Act 1986. (This includes the exceptions in Part 22 of the Insolvency (England and
                                          Wales) Rules 2016). These activities are-
(a)	acting as a director of another company that is known by a name which is either
                                          the same as a name used by the company in insolvent liquidation in the 12 months before
                                          it entered liquidation or is so similar as to suggest an association with that company;
(b)	directly or indirectly being concerned or taking part in the promotion, formation
                                          or management of any such company; or
(c)	directly or indirectly being concerned in the carrying on of a business otherwise
                                          than through a company under a name of the kind mentioned in (a) above.
This notice is given under rule 22.4 of the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016
                                          where the business of a company which is in, or may go into, insolvent liquidation
                                          is, or is to be, carried on otherwise than by the company in liquidation with the
                                          involvement of a director of that company and under the same or a similar name to
                                          that of that company.
The purpose of the giving of this notice is to permit the director to act in these
                                          circumstances where the company enters (or has entered) insolvent liquidation without
                                          the director committing a criminal offence and in the case of the carrying on of the
                                          business through another company, being personally liable for that company’s debts.
Notice may be given where the person giving the notice is already the director of
                                          a company which proposes to adopt a prohibited name.

In addition, in the event that a committee is not formed, creditors will also be asked

Creditors participating in the virtual meeting or attending by proxy, (unless a committee
                                          is formed), will also be asked to consider approving the basis of the joint liquidators
                                          remuneration and whether they also approve the joint liquidators drawing their disbursements,
                                          details of which have been provided in a report to creditors.
In order to be entitled to vote at the meeting (either in person or by proxy), creditors
                                          must have submitted a proof in respect of their claim (unless a proof has already
                                          been submitted) to the Convener via the contact details below, by no later than 4pm
                                          on 8 March 2024.

                                          Rules 2016, that the liquidator of 4DS ASSOCIATES LTD (""the Company"") (in members`
                                          voluntary liquidation) intends to make final distributions to creditors. Creditors
                                          are required to prove their debts on or before the date by which proofs must be delivered
                                          by sending full details of their claims to the liquidator. Creditors must also, if
                                          so requested by the liquidator, provide such further details and documentary evidence
                                          to support their claims as the liquidator deems necessary.
The intended distributions are final distributions and may be made without regard
                                          to the claim of any person in respect of a debt not proved by the date by which proofs
                                          must be delivered. Any creditor who has not delivered their proof by that date, or
                                          who increases the claim in their proof after that date, will not be entitled to disturb
                                          the intended final distributions. The liquidator intends that, after paying or providing
                                          for final distributions in respect of creditors who have proved their claims, all
                                          assets remaining in the liquidator`s hands following the final distributions to creditors
                                          shall be distributed to the shareholders of the Company absolutely.
The director has made a statutory declaration that the Company is able to pay all
                                          its known liabilities in full with interest at the official rate.

NOTICE UNDER SECTION 27 OF THE TRUSTEE ACT 1925
To Members and others claiming under the E&S Limited Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”),
                                          notice is hereby given, pursuant to section 27 of the Trustee Act 1925, that the Trustees
                                          of the Scheme are finalising its winding up and wish to trace any persons who were
                                          or are a member of the Scheme or who believe that they may have an interest or entitlement
                                          in the Scheme or a claim against the Scheme.
The Trustees believe they have identified everyone who has a right to benefits under
                                          the Scheme.
If you were a member of the Scheme and consider that you may have been entitled to
                                          benefits from the Scheme, or have a claim against the Scheme and have not already
                                          been contacted, please write to Paul Smith, Secretary to the Trustees of the E&S Limited
                                          Pension Scheme, Paragon Pension Services Limited, The Firs, 100 Reading Road, Finchampstead,
                                          Wokingham, RG40 4RA with full details of your claim and any benefits that you think
                                          you are entitled to, including your full name, address, NI Number, dates of employment
                                          and copies of any relevant papers, within 2 months of the date of publication of this
                                          advertisement.
After the 2-month period from the date of publication of this notice, the Trustees
                                          will proceed with the winding up of the Scheme and may have regard only to those claims,
                                          entitlements and interests of any nature of which they had prior notice and will not
                                          be liable to or in respect of any person whose claim or entitlement has not been so
                                          notified to them within the said 2-month period.
If the Trustees, or Paragon Pension Services Limited, are already in contact with
                                          you (for example if you have received correspondence from them in the last year or
                                          are receiving a pension) please do not reply to this notice since your interest has
                                          already been noted.
